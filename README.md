# Tensorflow_dog_cat_classification
This is the code for Kaggle competition:  dogs and cat classification

# Purpose:
This project is for testing my codes of the file: Layers.py.
I am now trying to package all the tensorflow details into some eazy usable functions,
since I believe it is a good way for either developping and learning.

# File description:
1. input_data.py: is for converting the input data into batches
2. Layers: packages written by tensorflow
3. train: the training configuration
4. if you want to run, you can just do as the following:
   import train
   train.training()
5. this project has not included validation and testing part.
